    "A common question in computer graphics is determining whether a point lies within a triangle.  Here we'll consider only case when the point and the triangle lie in the plane.  One way to answer this question is through the use of *barycentric coordinates*.  Given a triangle with vertices $A_1=(x_1, y_1), A_2=(x_2, y_2),$ and $A_3 = (x_3, y_3)$ and a point $P=(x, y)$ the barycentric coordinates of $P$ are $(\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\lambda_3)$ which satisfy the following two conditions.\n",
